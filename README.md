# COIT20256 - Assignment 1
This is the first assignment of the COIT20256 unit - Data Structure and Algorithm
In this assignment, I developed an application to track customer events at a shop, such as an ice cream shop. The events include arrival, ordering, being served, and leaving. The application adheres to specific constraints: events are processed on a first-in-first-out basis, and each event is randomly generated. However, there are dependencies: the order event occurs after the customer's arrival, the serve event occurs after the order, and customers leave the shop 5-10 minutes after being served.
